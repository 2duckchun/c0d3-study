    You learned way back in JS1 about setting an element's onclick attribute to assign a function to run when the user clicks on the element. 
    A downside to this method is that you can only assign one function to each element. 
    Best practice for our purposes is to add event listeners: addEventListener('eventName', function). 
    Let's see how our original example from JS1 would look with an event listener:
    */

    const button1 = document.querySelector('.submit1')
    button1.addEventListener('click', () => {
        alert("Ouch!!")
    })

    /*
    Other events you can add functions for include mouseenter, mouseleave, keyup, and mousemove. 
    When the browser runs your function for these events, it will pass in an object as an argument. 
    This object will contain properties such as the mouse position or the key that was pressed. 
    Let's look at a couple of examples:
    */

    /*
    MOUSEENTER
    This event fires when the mouse cursor first moves onto the element.
    */
    const title = document.querySelector('.mainTitle')
    title.addEventListener('mouseenter', (e) => {
        // To see other properties this object has, console.log(e) and explore!
        console.log(e)
    })

    /*
    KEYUP
    There are few events you can use to respond to typing; keyup occurs once every time the user releases a key. 
    Other key events include keydown and keypress; exact implementations may vary by browser, 
    but you can see how your browser handles each one on this cool JSFiddle. 
    In the following exercises, we'll be sticking with keyup.

    const input = document.querySelector('.bigInput')
    input.addEventListener('keyup', (e) => {
        console.log(e)
    })
